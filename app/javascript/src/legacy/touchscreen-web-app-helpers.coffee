# This file implements several helpers for fixing up full-page web apps on touchscreen
# browsers:
#
# EmulateDoubleClick
# ResponsiveSingleClick
# PreventDragScrolling
#
# Most of these are annoying hacks to work around the fact that WebKit on browsers was
# designed with displaying scrolling webpages in mind, apparently without consideration
# for full-screen applications: pages that should fill the screen at all times.  Most
# of the browser mobile hacks no longer make sense: separate display viewports, touch
# dragging, double-click zooming and their associated side-effects.
###

###
# Work around a bug on many touchscreen browsers: even when the page isn't
# zoomable, dblclick is never fired.  We have to emulate it.
#
# This isn't an exact emulation of the event behavior:
#
# - It triggers from touchstart rather than mousedown.  The second mousedown
#   of a double click isn't being fired reliably in Android's WebKit.
#
# - preventDefault on the triggering event should prevent a dblclick, but
#   we can't find out if it's been called; there's nothing like Firefox's
#   getPreventDefault.  We could mostly emulate this by overriding
#   Event.preventDefault to set a flag that we can read.
#
# - The conditions for a double click won't match the ones of the platform.
#
# This is needed on Android and iPhone's WebKit.
#
# Note that this triggers a minor bug on Android: after firing a dblclick event,
# we no longer receive mousemove events until the touch is released, which means
# PreventDragScrolling can't cancel dragging.
